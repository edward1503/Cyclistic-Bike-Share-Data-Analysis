    "Cyclistic operates a fleet of more than 5,800 bicycles which can be accessed from over 600 docking stations across the city. Bikes can be borrowed from one docking station, ridden, then returned to any docking stations. Over the years marketing campaigns have been broad and targeted a cross-section of potential users. Data analysis has shown that riders with an annual membership are more profitable than casual riders. Lily Moreno, the director of marketing, wants to implement a new marketing strategy in order to convert casual riders into annual members. She believes that with the right campaign there is a very good chance of such conversions between the user types. There are also user-friendly bike options include such as electric bikes, classic bikes and docked bikes. It makes Cyclistic services more inclusive to people. Lily has tasked the marketing analytics team to analyze past user data of one year to find trends and habits of Cyclistic's users to help create this marketing campaign. The marketing analyst team would like to know:\n",

The **files include 13 columns of information** related to ride details, such as **ride id, ridership type, ride time, start and end locations, and geographic coordinates...etc.** The data is organized in a way that allows for **analysis of trends and patterns** in the usage of Cyclistic's bike share services.\n",

This information is **important in understanding the behavioral differences** between the two groups and can be used to inform targeted marketing campaigns.

    "-   This plot demonstrates that **annual members tend to use the bikes more frequently during rush hour**, potentially for **commuting to and from work**. On the other hand, **casual riders show a more steady increase in usage throughout the day, with a peak at around 6pm and a steady decrease thereafter**. This suggests that casual riders may be using the bikes more **for leisure activities**. These insights provide valuable information on the **different usage patterns of annual members and casual riders**, which can inform strategies for promoting the bike share program and targeting different customer segments."

    "-   Annual members primarily use the bike-sharing service for commuting purposes, while casual riders tend to use it for leisure, particularly on weekends and in the summer months.\n",
    "-   Annual members exhibit a more consistent usage of the service throughout the week and year, compared to casual riders.\n",

    "-   Casual riders show lower usage of the service during the winter months compared to annual members.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 9.0.2 **Recommendations :**\n",
    "\n",
    "-   Increase marketing efforts targeting leisure riders, especiall on weekends, in order to increase bike usage and revenue.\n",
    "-   Consider offering discounts or incentives for annual members to encourage them to use the bikes more regularly throughout the week and year.\n",
    "-   Consider offering longer rental periods or multi-day rentals for casual riders, as their average ride length is longer than annual members, in order to increase revenue.\n"
