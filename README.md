## Project Overview

Cyclistic, a bike-sharing company, has provided data on bike rides taken by its customers. The goal of this project is to analyze the data, gain insights into customer behavior, and provide actionable recommendations to improve Cyclistic's bike-sharing service.

## Phase 1: Ask

In order to guide the future marketing campaign, the director of marketing assigned me the question: 

**How do annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes differently?**

This phase will elaborate on the business task and consider key stakeholders.

1. Business Task
 
In order to maximize the number of annual membership, me as a data analyst, will find trend and patterns among casual riders and membership riders, and identify potential riders who can get benefit from annual membership. I do not need to raise awareness of annual membership among casual riders as they are already aware of the program. 

2. Stakeholders

- The director of marketing
- The marketing analysis team
- Cyclistic's Executive team

3. Stakeholder's expectation

Design marketing strategies aimed at converting casual riders into annual members. In order to do that, however, the marketing analyst team needs to better understand how annual members and casual riders differ, why casual riders would buy a membership, and how digital media could affect their marketing tactics. The marketing team is interested in analyzing the Cyclistic historical bike trip data to identify trends.

## Phase 2: Prepare

The dataset I am using here is from Cyclistic's history trip data of each month in 2020 and made available by Motivate International Inc. Due to privacy issues, personal informations has been removed or encrypted. 

To verify the data's integrity, I will examine to have a broader view about the data by using ROCCC standard.
