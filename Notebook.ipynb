Scenario\nCyclistic operates a fleet of more than 5,800 bicycles which can be accessed from over 600 docking stations across the city. Bikes can be borrowed from one docking station, ridden, then returned to any docking stations. Over the years marketing campaigns have been broad and targeted a cross-section of potential users. Data analysis has shown that riders with an annual membership are more profitable than casual riders. Lily Moreno, the director of marketing, wants to implement a new marketing strategy in order to convert casual riders into annual members. She believes that with the right campaign there is a very good chance of such conversions between the user types. There are also user-friendly bike options include such as electric bikes, classic bikes and docked bikes. It makes Cyclistic services more inclusive to people. Lily has tasked the marketing analytics team to analyze past user data of one year to find trends and habits of Cyclistic's users to help create this marketing campaign. The marketing analyst team would like to know:\n\n-   **How annual members and casual riders differ**\n\n-   **Why casual riders would buy a membership**\n\n-   **How Cyclistic can use digital media to influence casual riders to become members.**\n\nHere I have to analyze the Cyclistic historical bike trip data to identify trends in the usage of bikes by casual and member riders.\n\n<br>","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## 3. **Phase 1: Ask**\n\n#### 3.0.1 **Business objective**\n\nThe business objective of the case study is to identify opportunities for targeted marketing campaigns to **convert casual riders into annual members**.

The ultimate goal is to **increase profitability** and drive future growth for the company.\n\n#### 3.0.2 **Business task**\n\nAs an analyst my take is to do following:-\n\n-   Analyze Cyclistic's historical bike trip data\n-   **Identify trends** and **patterns** in usage of bikes by **casual** and **member riders**\n-   **Understand behavior** and preferences of these two user groups\n-   Identify opportunities for targeted marketing campaigns to **convert casual riders into annual members**\n-   Use **insights from analysis** to inform development of **new marketing strategy** for the company\n-   **Goal:** increase profitability and drive future growth.\n\n#### 3.0.3 **Stakeholders**\n\nThe Stakeholders in this case study include:\n\n-   **Lily Moreno**: **Director of Marketing** at Cyclistic, who is **responsible for implementing the marketing campaigns** at Cyclistic.\n\n-   **Cyclistic's marketing team**: They will be responsible for conducting the analysis and **developing the marketing strategy** based on the insights gained.\n\n-   **Cyclistic's casual riders**: They are the **target audience** of the marketing campaign, and their behavior and preferences will be a **key focus of the analysis**.\n\n-   **Cyclistic's annual members**: They are the group that the marketing campaign is **trying to convert casual riders** into, and their behavior and preferences may be compared to those of casual riders in the analysis.\n\n-   **Cyclistic's investors and shareholders**: They have a **financial interest** in the company's success and may be **interested in the results** of the analysis and any changes to the marketing strategy.\n\n    <br>\n","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## 4. **Phase 2: Prepare**\n\n#### 4.0.1 **Where is your data located?**\n\nThe data for this analysis was obtained from **Motivate International Inc**. and can be **accessed through the provided [link](https://divvy-tripdata.s3.amazonaws.com/index.html).** It includes **first quarter of 2019 and 2020 of historical trip data from Cyclistic**, a fictional bike share company based in Chicago. It should be noted that the **data is public** and can be used to explore how different customer types are using Cyclistic bikes.\n\n#### 4.0.2 **How is the Data Organized?**\n\nFor this project, the data used consists of **2 CSV files** from the **past 3 months (January 2019 - March 2019 and January 2020 - March 2020)**. The **files include 13 columns of information** related to ride details, such as **ride id, ridership type, ride time, start and end locations, and geographic coordinates...etc.** The data is organized in a way that allows for **analysis of trends and patterns** in the usage of Cyclistic's bike share services.\n\n#### 4.0.3 **Credibility of data**\n\n**Motivate, Inc.** collected the [**data**](https://divvy-tripdata.s3.amazonaws.com/index.html) for this analysis directly through its **management of the Cyclistic Bike Share program for the City of Chicago**.

Through detailed observation of the variables in the data, it has been determined that **casual riders typically pay for individual or daily rides**, while **member riders tend to purchase annual subscriptions**.
